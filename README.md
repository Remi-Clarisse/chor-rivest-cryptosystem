# A study of the Chor-Rivest Cryptosystem

This work is/was done at the INRIA Saclay-Île de France by Rémi Clarisse (me writting) during an intership and supervised by Daniel Augot and Luca De Feo.

## sage & pdflatex

Here is the `sage` version used:

    SageMath version 7.5.1, Release Date: 2017-01-15

and the `pdflatex` version used:

    This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.16

## How does it work ?

First clone the git via :

    git clone https://github.com/Remi-Clarisse/chor-rivest-cryptosystem.git

Then move into the directory `chor-rivest-cryptosystem` and make the project :

    cd chor-rivest-cryptosystem/ && make

If everything went smoothly (maybe the `.tex` file can give you a hard time), move into `rapport-stage` where there are three directories and a pdf file.

The pdf file `rapport-stage.pdf` is a french manuscript of what I have done during this intership.

The folders have self-explanatory name and each contains a markdown `README.md` file, so help yourself ;)

> Thank you for checking out. Rémi (:
