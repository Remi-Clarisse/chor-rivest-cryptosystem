# A study of the Chor-Rivest Cryptosystem

This work is/was done at the [INRIA Saclay-Île de France](https://www.inria.fr/centre/saclay) by Rémi Clarisse (me writting) during an intership and supervised by [Daniel Augot](http://pages.saclay.inria.fr/daniel.augot/index-eng.html) and [Luca De Feo](http://defeo.lu/).

## sage & pdflatex

Here is the `sage` version used:

    SageMath version 7.5.1

and the `pdflatex` version used:

    pdfTeX 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.16 (TeX Live 2015/Debian)

It might be useful to check out `sage` [here](http://www.sagemath.org/) or [here if you use ubuntu](https://launchpad.net/~aims/+archive/ubuntu/sagemath) and `latex` [there](http://www.latex-project.org/).

## How does it work ?

First clone the git via :

    git clone https://github.com/Remi-Clarisse/chor-rivest-cryptosystem.git

Then move into the directory `chor-rivest-cryptosystem` and make the project :

    cd chor-rivest-cryptosystem/ && make

If everything went smoothly (maybe the `.tex` file can give you a hard time), move into `rapport-stage` where there are three directories and a pdf file.

The pdf file `rapport-stage.pdf` is a french manuscript of what I have done during this intership.

The folders have self-explanatory name and each contains a markdown `README.md` file, so help yourself ;)

> Thank you for checking out. Rémi (:
